This project is a Responsive Covid-19 tracker react page.

Otherwise, client cant search for a country information (today cases, recovered, deaths, critical) by simply searching country's name (full name, iso2, iso3). History section contains search history that uses localStorage to store history data and by clicking on clear button client can erase history.
